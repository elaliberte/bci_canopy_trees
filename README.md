# BCI Canopy Tree species list

This repo compiles different data sources to build a checklist of all known canopy tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

The goal is then to compare to our own data on labelled close-up drone photos of canopy trees in this whole-island BCI mapping effort (<https://arcg.is/0uWLK4>) to determine the extent to which we've sampled most or all canopy tree species, or not.

## Data sources to build the checklist

1.  Vásquez, V., K. C. Cushman, P. Ramos, C. Williamson, P. Villareal, L. F. Gomez Correa, and H. C. Muller-Landau. 2023. Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot crown maps: manually segmented and instance segmented. Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Smithsonian Figshare. <https://doi.org/10.25573/data.24784053>

2.  Wright, S. Joseph. 2024. Tree census data for the 25-ha, 10-ha and tower plots on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Smithsonian Figshare. <https://doi.org/10.25573/data.24531133> (filtered to only consider trees \>20 cm DBH, which are likely to be in the canopy)

The species names are all matched to [WCVP](https://powo.science.kew.org/about-wcvp).
